            <p>
              <br />
              First and foremost, our experiences during our work immersion were
              nothing short of interesting. We gained valuable knowledge about
              what to expect after completing our studies. Experiencing this
              early on allowed us to realize things we hadn't fully understood
              until now. Though, truthfully, much of our time during the
              immersion was spent waiting, the experiences we gained during
              those moments were nonetheless priceless.

            <p>
              Today marks the first day of our immersion program, and we had the
              privilege of attending the flag ceremony alongside the city
              officials and employees. It was a meaningful experience as we
              witnessed the formal proceedings and the sense of unity and
              patriotism among the participants. This opportunity allowed us to
              gain insight into the local government's structure and operations
              while reinforcing the importance of discipline, respect, and civic
              duty. We look forward to the learnings and experiences that this
              immersion will bring in the days ahead.

              We are currently waiting for our tour guide, Ma'am Jackie, who is one of the dedicated employees of the Information and
              Communications Technology Office (ICTO). She will be guiding us through our tour, providing valuable insights into the 
              department's functions, operations, and contributions to the city's technological advancements. We are excited to learn 
              from her expertise and gain a deeper understanding of how ICTO plays a crucial role in the city's digital infrastructure 
              and services.

            <h2>Programming</h2>
            <p>
                The first couple of days of our immersion have been quite interesting. 
                While there were moments of downtime, we made the most of our time by working on a websiteâ€”this very one. 
                Engaging in this project not only helped us stay productive but also allowed us to apply our skills in web development, 
                enhancing our creativity and technical knowledge. 
                It has been a great way to collaborate, learn, and make the experience more meaningful. 
                We look forward to further improving the site and gaining more hands-on experience in the days to come.
